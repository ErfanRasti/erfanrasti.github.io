<div style="text-align: justify;">
This project includes the configuration I use to setup my Arch Linux.<br>
<ul>
  <li>It includes many customizations to make pure Arch fully functional for a daily desktop or laptop user.</li>
  <li>This documentation is primarily for Arch Linux, but many of these configurations can also be widely used with other Linux distros.</li>
  <li>All of these setup commands have been tested and used on my primary system, so they are reasonably safe to use.</li>
</ul>
